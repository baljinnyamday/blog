Soooooouu, on my first day, I went to visit my campus because I just moved to London. I was so excited to explore the place where I would be spending the next year of my life. The campus is absolutely stunning. And then I saw hackaton was about to happen asked if I could join, they welcomed me got into random team built a project got second place. It was 4 day hackaton so, got pretty tired. Instead of doing hackaton I should have found a place to stay. So I was basically homeless for 2 days, sleeping in the campus, library, and random places. Oh also, I met with few people from Mongolia last friday, I kinda liked the vibe as everyone was tech savvy. Met with some unexpected people as well. 

Just attached some pictures.
