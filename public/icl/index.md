It's been a long journey.

I wrote this after I got into Imperial College London for my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

<b>For my future children,</b> At the time of writing this post, Imperial was ranked second in the world. So I am expecting a MIT from you :b .


Nah, just kidding, do what you love, enjoy whatever makes you happy :).
