It's been a long journey.

One would say I've aged 5 years only last year.

I decided not to write this blog but just share you a update about my life (check blog on oct 12).
I wrote this after I got into Imperial College London for my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (specializing in Entrepreneurship and Deep Learning).

<b>For my future children,</b> at the moment I write this, Imperial was ranked second in the world. So I am expecting a MIT from you :b .

Nah, just kidding, do what you love, enjoy whatever makes you happy :).
